# Spaceship-Game
A drone on a ship doing little things (in very primitive state)

My game is uploaded with the separate files! I really need help on some sections.
I started this code when I had only a few months of experience in code,
and there are a huge amount of errors I'm sure, but for the most, it has worked fine.
But there is an issue with the tablet (function in line 150-382) that I can't get around. When I try to blit
text, it is always flashing to some extent, and nothing I try fixes it. I cant tell whether there is an issue
with the function itself or an issue somewhere else in the code that is causing it.
